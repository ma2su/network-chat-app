# Network Chat Application

This project is a client/server messaging application designed to allow multiple users
to exchange messages over a network. It focuses on understanding how applications
communicate, how data is transmitted, and how a server manages multiple clients.

## Project Overview

The application is based on a client/server architecture. A central server handles
connections, user management, and message exchanges, while clients connect to the
server to send and receive messages. The goal of this project is to provide a practical
and concrete approach to network communication and distributed application design.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in programming, networking concepts, and
application logic, while gaining a better understanding of how real-world networked
applications operate.
